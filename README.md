Riptide is a browser-based platform that combines a persistent PTY terminal with stackable markdown playbooks, real-time multi-user collaboration, and structured data management — built for pentest engagements, CTF competitions, and red team operations. Think of it as a shared war room where your team runs commands, documents findings, and manages credentials in one place.

## Highlights

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

### Terminal + Playbooks
A full xterm.js terminal on the right, stackable markdown note sections on the left. Fenced code blocks get **Run** buttons that execute directly in the terminal — click to run, capture the output, and it's saved back into your notes.

</td>
<td width="50%">

### Real-Time Collaboration
Password-protected rooms with WebSocket sync. Multiple users see each other's presence, get live updates on notes/credentials/variables, and edit locks prevent conflicts. Late-joining users see buffered terminal output (up to 256KB per PTY).

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

### Variable Substitution
Use `<TargetIP>`, `<Domain>`, or any custom variable in code blocks. Riptide scans your playbooks, renders input fields, and substitutes values at runtime. Variables support **tab** (per-target) and **global** (room-wide) scope.

</td>
<td width="50%">

### Credential Vault
Store service/username/password/hash combos per target or globally. Click-to-reveal secrets, one-click copy, bulk export to `credentials.txt` / `usernames.txt` / `passwords_hashes.txt`. Flag findings to alert the whole team.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

### Output Intelligence
After capturing terminal output, the parser automatically extracts IPs, URLs, emails, hashes, credentials, and nmap ports — highlighted inline with one-click promote actions to push findings into the credential vault or scope panel.

</td>
<td width="50%">

### Playbook Library
Build your own library of reusable playbooks organized by category and tags. Search, import into rooms, customize, and share across engagements.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

### Knowledge Base
A persistent, cross-room knowledge base for techniques, tools, findings, and references. Promote entries directly from playbooks, credentials, scratch notes, or alerts with one click. Search and filter by type or tag from the toolbar or login screen.

</td>
<td width="50%">

### Real-Time Chat
Built-in messaging with global (room-wide) and tab-scoped channels. Messages group by user with timestamps, unread indicators, and toast notifications when teammates aren't looking at the panel.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Version |
|-------------|---------|
| Node.js | >= 18 |
| npm | >= 9 |
| Platform | Linux, macOS, or Windows (with build tools for [node-pty](https://github.com/nicedoc/node-pty)) |

### Install & Launch

#### Local

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Real-Fruit-Snacks/Riptide.git
cd Riptide
npm install
npm start
```

Open **https://localhost:3000** in your browser. Create a room, set a password, and you're in.

> HTTPS is enabled by default — Riptide auto-generates a self-signed certificate on first launch (requires `openssl` on your PATH). Your browser will warn about the self-signed cert; accept it to proceed.

```bash
# Disable HTTPS
NO_SSL=1 npm start

# Use your own certificate
SSL_KEY=/path/to/your.key SSL_CERT=/path/to/your.cert npm start

# Or use the launch script with flags
./start.sh --no-ssl --port 8443
```

#### Docker

##### Build

``` bash
docker build -t riptide https://github.com/Real-Fruit-Snacks/Riptide.git
```

##### Run with HTTPS

``` bash
docker run --name riptide -p 3000:3000 -d riptide
```

##### Run with HTTP

``` bash
docker run --name riptide -e NO_SSL=1 -p 3000:3000 -d riptide
```

##### Stop

``` bash
docker stop riptide && docker rm riptide
```

### Development

```bash
npm run dev          # Start with --watch (auto-restart on changes)
npm run lint         # ESLint with 0-warning policy
npm test             # Run all 675 tests
npm run test:watch   # Watch mode
```

## Architecture

Riptide is a vanilla JavaScript application with **no build step** — static files are served directly from `public/`. The backend is a modular Express server with dual WebSocket support for real-time sync and terminal I/O.

```

```

### Dual WebSocket System

| Endpoint | Purpose | Details |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `/ws/terminal` | PTY I/O | stdin/stdout streaming, resize events, 256KB ring buffer for late-join replay |
| `/ws/sync` | State broadcast | Note edits, credential changes, presence tracking, edit locks, finding alerts, chat messages, KB sync |

### Data Storage

Each room can specify a **working directory** — a filesystem path where all engagement data lives, organized by target:

```
{workDir}/
├── tabs.json                    # Tab config, variables
├── global-credentials.json      # Room-wide credentials
├── global-variables.json        # Room-wide variables
├── alerts.json                  # Flagged findings (capped at 200)
├── chat-global.json             # Room-wide chat messages
└── {TargetName}/                # Per-target folder
    ├── *.md                     # Playbook notes
    ├── credentials.json         # Target-scoped credentials
    ├── scratch-notes.json       # Quick notes
    ├── chat.json                # Tab-scoped chat messages
    └── credentials.txt          # Exported credentials
```

## Security

Riptide is designed for use on trusted networks during authorized engagements.

| Layer | Implementation |
|-------|----------------|
| **Authentication** | scrypt password hashing (N=32768, r=8, p=2), 24-hour session expiry |
| **TLS** | HTTPS by default with auto-generated self-signed certs, TLS 1.2 minimum |
| **Transport** | helmet (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options), WebSocket origin validation |
| **Rate limiting** | 15 requests per 15 minutes on auth endpoints |
| **Sanitization** | DOMPurify on all rendered markdown, path traversal protection |
| **Body limits** | 256KB request body limit |

> **Warning**: Riptide is intended for internal/lab use during engagements. Do not expose to the public internet without additional hardening — proper CA-signed certificates, reverse proxy, and network-level access control.

---

## Configuration

Riptide uses sensible defaults with no config file required. Customize via environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PORT` | `3000` | Server port |
| `HOST` | `0.0.0.0` | Bind address |
| `NO_SSL` | *(unset)* | Set to `1` to disable HTTPS |
| `SSL_KEY` | `certs/server.key` | Path to TLS private key |
| `SSL_CERT` | `certs/server.cert` | Path to TLS certificate |

Theme selection is per-user via **Settings > General > Theme** and persists in localStorage.

---

## Playbooks

Playbooks are markdown files in the `playbooks/` directory. Add frontmatter for metadata:

````markdown
---
title: Network Reconnaissance
description: Initial network enumeration and service discovery
category: Recon
tags: [nmap, network, enumeration]
---

## Host Discovery

```bash
nmap -sn <TargetSubnet>
```

## Port Scan

```bash
nmap -sCV -p- <TargetIP> -oN nmap_full.txt
```
````

Variables like `<TargetIP>` are detected automatically and rendered as input fields in the UI. Values persist per-tab and substitute at runtime when you click **Run**.

---

## Testing

```bash
npm test                      # All 675 tests
npm run test:unit             # Unit tests only
npm run test:integration      # Integration tests only
npm run test:coverage         # With V8 coverage report
npx vitest run -t "pattern"   # Run tests matching a name
```

Tests are fully isolated — each file creates its own temp directory and cleans up after itself. No shared state between test files.

### Code Style
